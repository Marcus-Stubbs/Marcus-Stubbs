### Hi thereðŸ‘‹

I am Marcus Stubbs from Boyds, Maryland and I am an aspiring IT/Cybersecurity Specialist. I enjoy challenging myself by learning new coding langauges such as python and HTML. I also enjoy practicing running port scans to detect vulnerabilities on network servers within virtual environments such as VMware and Microsoft Azure.
